# PHP solution to Fibonacci sequence


## Problem

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, â€¦
```

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Answer

fibo.php

```
<?php

    $i = 0;
	$j = 1;
	$k = 1;
	$total = 0;
	
	while($k < 4000000){
		$i = $j;
		$j = $k;
		$k = $i + $j;
		if($k % 2 == 0){
			$total += $k; 
		}
	}

	echo $total;
    
?>
```
